# Ambio Adaptive management modelling and analysis
This repository includes the code to run GOTM modelling using a sensitivity approach to investigate how changes in flow will interact with air temeprature warming to impact lake water temperatures. 

The steps are 1. run GOTM scenarios; 2. run post-model analysis; and 3. Generate figures
## To reproduce figures only
- Run 05_manuscript_plots.R

## To rerun post-modelling analysis
- Run 02_xxx
- Run 03_xxx
- Run 04_xxx
- Run 05_manuscript_plots.R
  
## To run the GOTM scenarios
- Run 01_run_scenarios.R
- Run 02_xxx
- Run 03_xxx
- Run 04_xxx
- Run 05_manuscript_plots.R

The configuration files for GOTM calibration using ParSAC are also provided but not included in the above workflow.
